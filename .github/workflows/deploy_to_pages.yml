# This workflow is responsible for deploying the application to GitHub Pages.

# 1. Name the workflow
name: ðŸš€ Deploy to GitHub Pages (CD)

# 2. Define the trigger
# This workflow only runs when a push happens to the 'main' branch,
# ensuring the CI part (if you added one) has already passed.
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # Allows manual execution
  workflow_dispatch:

# 3. Define permissions required for deployment
# The GITHUB_TOKEN needs write access to the pages/id-token for deployment
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# 4. Define the jobs
jobs:
  # This job handles the actual deployment
  deploy:
    # Runs on the latest Ubuntu runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # Ensures the deployment only starts after the environment is configured
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the GitHub Pages environment
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5

      # Step 3: Upload the application files as an artifact
      # We assume the index.html (your app) is at the root of the repository ('.')
      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          # This specifies the directory containing the content to be deployed.
          # Since our simple HTML is at the root, we use '.'
          path: '.'

      # Step 4: Deploy the artifact to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
